//Example 1: In this example, we have created a custom exception class NegativeBalanceException,
//which extends Exception, as well as a class BankAccount, which includes a withdrawal method.
//If the balance is less than the amount withdrawn, an instance of NegativeBalanceException
//with an error message is thrown. The exception is then caught and the error message is printed
//in the main method.
