- Access Modifiers: Demonstration of public, private, protected, and package-private access modifiers.
- Setters and Getters: Using methods to access and modify private data fields.
- Garbage Collection: Explanation of garbage collection in Java and demonstration of finalizers.
- Inheritance: Examples of single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance in Java.
- Constructors: Working with default, parameterized, and copy constructors.
- Method Overloading and Overriding: Programs that showcase polymorphism through overloading and overriding methods.
- Polymorphism: Concepts of compile-time and runtime polymorphism with examples.
- Exception Handling: Try, Catch, Finally: Basics of exception handling in Java.
- Custom Exceptions: How to define and use custom exception classes.
- Checked and Unchecked Exceptions: Explanation of different types of exceptions in Java.

## Multithreading
- Creating Threads: Different ways to create threads in Java using Thread class and Runnable interface.
- Synchronization: Handling synchronization in multi-threaded applications.
- Thread Lifecycle: Understanding the lifecycle of a thread and thread methods.

## CRUD Application using JDBC
